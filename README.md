This app allows the user to schedule to-do items at common business hours to improve time management. The app can be accessed through this [link](https://smg061.github.io/workdayscheduler)

# Features

## Time slots at common business hours 

The app allows the user to enter events in the scheduler starting from 9 AM and until 5PM.


## Dynamic styling of time slots

Depending on the current hour, the time slots are colored gray ( time slot has already passed), red (current hour), or green (time slots in the future)
